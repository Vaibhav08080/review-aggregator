**Installation****1. Clone the Repository**Clone the project repository to your local machine:bashCopy``` git clone https://github.com/your-username/price-comparison-tool.git cd price-comparison-tool ```**2. Install Dependencies**Install the required Python libraries:bashCopy``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```**Usage****1. Run the Project**Run the `main.py` script:bashCopy``` python main.py ```**2. Input a Product Link**When prompted, enter the **Amazon product link**:Copy``` Enter the Amazon product link: https://www.amazon.in/dp/B08XXX ```**3. View Results**The program will:1. Extract product details from Amazon.1. Search for similar products on Flipkart.1. Display the results, including:- Product name- Price- Description- Recommendation (Buy, Wait, or Don't Buy).**Project Structure**Copy``` price-comparison-tool/ │ ├── main.py # Main script to run the program ├── scraper.py # Web scraping logic for Amazon and Flipkart ├── utils.py # Helper functions (e.g., fuzzy matching, BERT embeddings) ├── requirements.txt # List of dependencies └── README.md # Instructions for running the project ```**Dependencies**The project uses the following Python libraries:- `beautifulsoup4`: For web scraping.- `requests`: For making HTTP requests.- `fuzzywuzzy`: For fuzzy string matching.- `transformers`: For BERT-based NLP.- `torch`: For PyTorch (required by `transformers`).- `scikit-learn`: For cosine similarity.**How It Works**1. **Web Scraping**:- The program scrapes product details (name, price, description) from Amazon and Flipkart.1. **AI-Based Matching**:- It uses **BERT embeddings** to compare product descriptions and identify similar products.1. **Recommendation**:- Based on price and reviews, the program suggests whether to buy, wait, or avoid a product.**Example Output**Copy``` Extracting product details... Product Name: Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Headphones Price: ₹24,999 Description: Noise-cancelling over-ear headphones with 30-hour battery life. Searching for similar products on Flipkart... Exact Match Found: Sony WH-1000XM4 Bluetooth Headphones - ₹24,500 Similar Product: Sony WH-CH710N - ₹15,000 Recommendation: Buy from Flipkart (cheaper price). ```**Troubleshooting****1. ModuleNotFoundError**If you encounter errors like `ModuleNotFoundError`, ensure all dependencies are installed:bashCopy``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```**2. Web Scraping Issues**- If scraping fails, ensure the HTML structure of the website hasn't changed. Update the `BeautifulSoup` selectors in `scraper.py`.- If the website uses JavaScript to load content, switch to **Selenium** for scraping.**3. AI Model Issues**- If the BERT model fails to load, ensure you have a stable internet connection (the model is downloaded from Hugging Face).- If you're behind a proxy, configure your environment to use the proxy.**Contributing**Contributions are welcome!
